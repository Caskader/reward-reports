                    <p>It aims to provide a simple interface to build from scratch a new Reward Report or to edit an existing one.</p>
                    <p>This is also the place to visualize how your reports for a single model has changed overtime.</p>
                    <p>The generated reward reports can be downloaded or directly pushed to your model hosted on the Hub.</p>
